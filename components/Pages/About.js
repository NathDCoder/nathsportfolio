      <p>
        My name is Nathanael Thomas, thanks for visiting my page.
        I love the world of photography. I started honing this skill as a teenager and now some years
        later I've had the opportunity to capture some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
        I am always looking for ways to improve in my skill to capture those special moments in nature and life.
        Take a look at my projects and if you like what you see feel free to contact me.
      </p>
