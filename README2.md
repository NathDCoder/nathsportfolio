# Portfolio Project
 This is my attempt at the portfolio project.
I believe I completed most of the requirements for this project.
I learned a lot from doing this project and enjoyed making this portfolio.
I started out by creating a REACT app. Then I installed all the packages I would need initially.
Then in the source folder I created a components foler containing all of the websites interactions and pages. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I built my App.JS that would return the Home page and Footer and also return the PageChanger.JS 
contains functions to change the page accordning to what the user would click. Afterwards I created the Index.JS to render the pages to the Root html page in the public folder.
After setting that up I built the pages that would be rendered in the Pages Folder.
Then I created a form folder with a Form, so users can write their email and Name to contact me.
This part still really doesn't do anything unfornately like I intended it to do. But it does accept values and clears after submitting. I also created a helper function to allow only certain values and to alert the user if requirement is not met or nothing was inputted.

Lastly I attached some styling and Resume that Downloads a PDF. It's ust an example Resume.
